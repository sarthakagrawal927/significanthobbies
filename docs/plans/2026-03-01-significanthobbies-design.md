## Overview

A web app where users map their hobby history across life phases, visualize how hobbies evolved, share a beautiful "hobby passport" profile, and discover new hobbies to pursue. Core loop: build timeline → see insights → discover new hobbies → export/share.

## Data Model (Prisma + Turso)

```prisma
model User {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  name          String?
  email         String    @unique
  emailVerified DateTime?
  image         String?
  username      String?   @unique
  accounts      Account[]
  sessions      Session[]
  timelines     Timeline[]
  createdAt     DateTime  @default(now())
}

model Timeline {
  id         String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId     String?
  title      String?
  visibility String   @default("PRIVATE") // PRIVATE | UNLISTED | PUBLIC
  slug       String?  @unique
  phases     Json     // structured phase data
  createdAt  DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt  DateTime @updatedAt
  user       User?    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}

// NextAuth tables: Account, Session, VerificationToken
```

### Phase JSON Structure

```ts
type Phase = {
  id: string
  label: string
  ageStart?: number
  ageEnd?: number
  yearStart?: number
  yearEnd?: number
  hobbies: { name: string; intensity?: 1|2|3|4|5; notes?: string }[]
  order: number
}
```

## Key Flows

### Guest Flow
1. Visit `/timeline/new` without login
2. Build timeline — autosaved to localStorage on every change
3. Preview insights inline
4. Export PNG or JSON without account
5. On login prompt: "Save to your profile?" → import draft

### Auth Flow
- Google OAuth only via NextAuth
- On first login: prompt to set `username` (used for `/@username` profile)
- Username: lowercase, alphanumeric + hyphens, 3–30 chars

### Publish Flow
1. Owner sets visibility to UNLISTED or PUBLIC
2. `nanoid(10)` slug generated and stored
3. Shareable link: `/t/[slug]`
4. PRIVATE timelines return 404 for non-owners even if slug known

---

## Insights (Pure Functions)

Located in `/lib/insights.ts` — all pure, all unit-tested.

- **addedPerPhase**: hobbies in phase N not in phase N-1
- **droppedPerPhase**: hobbies in phase N-1 not in phase N
- **rekindled**: hobby that appears → disappears → reappears
- **mostPersistent**: hobbies present in most phases (ranked)
- **coOccurrencePairs**: hobby pairs within same phase (top 20)

---

## Visual Design

- **Palette**: `slate-950` bg, `emerald-500` primary accent, `slate-100` text
- **Font**: Geist Sans (Next.js default)
- **Timeline builder**: vertical phase cards with drag handle, expandable hobbies list
- **Timeline view**: horizontal swimlane, phases as blocks, hobby chips
- **Persistence grid**: hobby rows × phase columns, intensity-colored cells
- **Export card**: 1200×630, warm gradient bg, horizontal phase blocks, top hobbies strip, rekindled badge — designed to look like a shareable artifact

---

## Security

- Private timeline slugs → 404 for non-owners
- All inputs validated with Zod
- CSRF handled by NextAuth
- No PII in demo/seeded data
- Username uniqueness enforced at DB level

---

## Discovery Features

### Hobby Directory (`/hobbies`)
- Browsable grid of hobby categories (Creative, Physical, Intellectual, Social, etc.)
- Each hobby links to `/hobbies/[hobby]`

### Hobby Page (`/hobbies/[hobby]`)
- Description of the hobby
- Public profiles/timelines that include this hobby (paginated)
- "Add to my next phase" CTA for logged-in users

### Personalized Suggestions
- Shown on `/timeline/[id]` and `/@[username]` for the owner
- Rule-based for v1: look at hobby categories present in history, suggest hobbies in similar categories not yet tried
- "People with similar timelines also explored..." — driven by co-occurrence across public timelines
- Max 6 suggestions shown

### Data additions
- `HobbyCategory` table or static map: hobby → category
- No new tables needed for suggestions — query co-occurrence from public timeline phases JSON

## Out of Scope (v1)

- Explore trends (placeholder only)
- Aggregate contribution / cohort stats
- Synthetic API endpoint
- Hobby normalization / canonicalization
- Anonymous publish
- Admin panel
- Magic link / email auth
- Gender/region filters
